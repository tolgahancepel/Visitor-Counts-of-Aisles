## Visitor Counts of Aisles

### About

I have designed this project for my Internet of Things (IoT) class at Sakarya University, December 2019. My main purpose is collecting data with IR sensors and send it to cloud platform using ESP8266 WiFi Module. By using ThingSpeak platform, we can visualize that how many times the aisles visited. This data may be helpful for bookshops, cloting shops, etc.

#### Hardware Components
